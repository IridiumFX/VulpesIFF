IFF-2025 Conformance Test Matrix
=================================

This document defines the complete set of conformance tests for IFF-2025
parser and generator implementations. Tests are numbered globally and
organized by functional area.

Tests marked **[COVERED]** have existing implementations. All others are new.

| W73 | chunk_encoder_binary_layout | ChunkEncoder output byte-identical to TestBuilder with post-transform data. **[COVERED: test 25]** |

### B12.3 Encoder + Progressive Mode

| #  | Test | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| W74 | encode_progressive | WriteHeader(progressive) + EncodeForm. Output includes ' END'. Parse succeeds. `iff85_locked == 0`. **[COVERED: test 26]** |


B13. Header Flag Effects on Generation
-----------------------------------------

### B13.1 Size Width

| #  | Test | Description |
|----|------|-------------|

| W76 | gen_sizing_64 | WriteHeader(sizing=64). FORM chunk sizes written as 8-byte fields. Output matches TestBuilder. Parse succeeds. |

### B13.2 Tag Width

| #  | Test | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| W77 | gen_tag_sizing_8 | WriteHeader(tag_sizing=8). Tags written as 8 bytes. Output matches TestBuilder with 8-byte tags. Parse succeeds. |
| W78 | gen_tag_sizing_16 | WriteHeader(tag_sizing=16). Tags written as 16 bytes. Parse succeeds. |

### B13.3 Endianness

| #  | Test | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| W79 | gen_little_endian | WriteHeader(typing=LITTLE_ENDIAN). Size fields written in LE order. Output matches TestBuilder(is_le=1). Parse succeeds. |
| W80 | gen_le_unsigned_combined | WriteHeader(typing=LE+UNSIGNED). Both flags active. Output matches TestBuilder. Parse succeeds. |

### B13.4 Structuring

| #  | Test | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| W81 | gen_no_padding | WriteHeader(structuring=NO_PADDING). Odd-size chunks have no pad byte. Output matches TestBuilder. Parse succeeds. |

| W87 | roundtrip_progressive | Generate progressive FORM, parse, verify. **[COVERED: test 21]** |
| W88 | roundtrip_nested_containers | Generate CAT > LIST > FORM with PROP, parse, verify complete structure. |
| W89 | roundtrip_all_container_types | Generate file with FORM, LIST (with PROP), and CAT in sequence. Parse all three. |
| W90 | roundtrip_checksum | Generate CHK..SUM around chunk. Parse verifies checksum. **Related to test 20]** |

| W98 | roundtrip_encoder_progressive_checksum | Generate: header(progressive) + BeginChecksumSpan + EncodeForm + EndChecksumSpan + Flush. Parse verifies checksum and structure. |


B16. Bytes Written Tracking
-----------------------------

| #  | Test | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| W99 | bytes_written_single_chunk | After WriteChunk, scope's bytes_written == tag_len + size_len + data_size + padding. |
| W100 | bytes_written_two_chunks | After two WriteChunk calls, scope's bytes_written is cumulative total. |
| W101 | bytes_written_filler | WriteFiller(8) adds tag_len + size_len + 8 to bytes_written. |
| W102 | bytes_written_nested | Nested FORM's bytes contribute to parent scope's bytes_written on EndForm. |
